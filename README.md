# Operations-Research-Course-Project
Course Projects for Operations Research in USTC (2021 Fall).  The course is lectured by <a href="http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~yangzw/">Prof. Zhouwang Yang</a>.

Many problems in practical applications are mathematically ill posed, i.e., there exists a lot of decision alternatives. Usually, such problems are established as an optimization model, which minimizes (or maximize) an objective function subject to constraints. Art of modeling and solving optimization models are the core contents of Operations Research. This course includes: various models (linear programming, network models, dynamic programming, nonlinear optimization, decision analysis, etc.), their algorithms and implementation.
